            <h4>Where I am</h4>
            <p>During my first HTML basic trial, I delved into web development and crafted a web page from scratch, experiencing the satisfaction of seeing 
            my creation come to life and fueling my passion for HTML. </p>
            <p>Currently, my progress in web development is going well. I am gaining a deeper understanding of HTML and expanding my knowledge by exploring more 
            advanced concepts and techniques.</p>
            <p>As an aspiring web developer, I am currently at the stage of learning and practicing HTML basics. I have successfully created my first web page and are eager to continue expanding my skills and knowledge 
                in web development.</p>
            <p>Embarking on my first HTML trial was an exhilarating experience that ignited my passion for web development. Through creating my first web page, I gained valuable hands-on
             knowledge and the motivation to further explore and master the world of HTML and web development.</p>
